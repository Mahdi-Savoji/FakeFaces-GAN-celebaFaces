# GAN Network for Generating Fake Faces on CelebA Dataset

This repository contains a Python script that implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate fake faces using the CelebA Faces dataset.

## Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning. They consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other in a game-theoretic framework. In this case, the generator aims to produce realistic images of faces, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and fake images.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   https://github.com/Mahdi-Savoji/FakeFaces-GAN-celebaFaces

2. Install the required dependencies.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have downloaded the CelebA Faces dataset and placed it in the appropriate directory.

2. Run the Python script `CelebFaces-FakeFace.ipynb` using the following command.
